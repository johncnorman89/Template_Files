Your Django install (with sample project) is complete. As your next step, you will need to point a subdomain (vhost) at the "django/django-vhost" folder and make sure that FastCGI is enabled for it. The sample project page should appear when you view the newly created URL. 

When working with Django from the shell, you will need to adjust your path to include Django's special Python installation. In bash (your default shell), type: 
export PATH=$HOME/django/django-python/bin:$PATH
